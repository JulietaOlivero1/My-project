    <h1>SANTA MARIA NOVELLA</h1>

    <h2>The ancient cathedral of Florence.</h2>

    <P id="semi1"><STRong>Date:</STRong>1458 d.c.</P>
    <P id="semi1"><STRong>Author:</STRong>Leon Battista Alberti</P>
    <P id="semi1"><STRong>Place:</STRong>Florence</P>
            
    <h3>Charge</h3>
    <p>Alberti's extensive knowledge of the monuments of Rome is attested to by his Descriptio urbis Romae, written around 1433 during his first prolonged stay in Rome. <strong>Alberti</strong> received the commission for the façade of Santa Maria Novella from Giovanni di Paolo Rucellai, who had been forced to retire from political activity and <em>“He sought to demonstrate his importance in the life of the city.”</em> </p>
    
    <h3>Place</h3>
    <p>In the 15th century <strong>Florence</strong> was a city-state that governed only Prato, Pistoia, Pisa, Volterra, Cortona Arezzo, and their areas. inland agriculture. <em>“The city of Florence proper had in 1343 a population of about 91,500 souls; We do not have a similarly reliable estimate for the years after the Renaissance, but we can assume that the population grew as trade and industry prospered.”</em></p>


    <h3>Architectural culture to which it belongs</h3>
    
    <p>The rise of the middle classes, related to the concentration of money in certain social groups, allowed <em>“the growth of universities, of knowledge and philosophy, the realistic sharpening of minds through the study of law, the expansionof minds through greater knowledge of the world (...)”</em> Northern Italy was more urban and industrial than any other region in Europe except Flanders.</p>

    <p>Through the organization of its industry, the extension of its trade and the operations of its financiers, Florence was in the 14th century the richest city on the peninsula, with the exception of Venice. To finance this industry and commerce, and many other things, the eighty banking houses of Florence - mainly the Bardi, Peruzzi, Strozzi, Pitti and Medici - invested the savings of their depositors. They cashed checks, issued letters of credit, exchanged goods and credit, and supplied funds to governments.”</p>

    <p>This intellectual climate believed that antiquity <em>“was to serve as a model for a modern cultural renaissance or Renaissance. (...) Humanist scholars promoted “human” studies, that is, worthy of the dignity of man.” </em> understanding this as made in the image and likeness of God. This centralized view of man and his capabilities led to the development of multifaceted “universal men” who could function in different areas or activities at the same time.</p>

    <h3>Dimensions and construction characteristics</h3>

    <p>Medieval church that had been left unfinished at the end of the 13th century. The lower part of the façade had been completed, in addition to the Gothic niches and tombs, the side doors under pointed arches and the circular window in the center. Alberti replaced the exterior niches on each side with Renaissance corners, and the niches flanking the door with the portico. In the Middle Ages, the upper part of the façade had not been finished, and Alberti was free to alter it, preserving only the rose window, which he barely modified. The rosettes embellish the square fields introduced in the attic, and other ornamental motifs appear in the rectangular fields behind the pilasters of the upper part (facade of a Greek temple), the tapestry of motifs is inspired by the covering of San Miniato.</p>
    
    <p>What is <strong>innovative</strong> is the incorporation of elements from antiquity like:</p>

    <ol>
    <li>the attic.</li>
    <li>the pediment.</li>
    <li>the entablature.</li>
    <li>the podium.</li>
    <li>the curved volutes</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Alberti divides the entire space in such a way that the height of the building is equal to its width, thus forming a single large square. This is in turn subdivided at half its height at the baseline of the volutes, which mask the corridors. The lower part of the façade forms two squares with sides 1/2 A, divided by the main door that is inspired by the pantheon. Each of these has 1/4 the surface of the large square of side A. The upper story, which contains a pediment, has the same side 1/2 A as the two lower squares</p>
