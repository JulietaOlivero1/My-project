   <h1>What is Santa Mar√≠a Novella today?</h1>

   <p>The Basilica is one of the most important religious buildings in Florence. It is the first to welcome visitors arriving in the city from the train station that bears the same name in honor of the beautiful church. In addition to being a place of worship, the church is above all an exhibition space of undoubted prestige, thanks to the presence of works by many of the greatest artists of the Renaissance era, who wanted to leave their mark on the church. 
    The complex is also made up of beautiful outdoor spaces, among which are the Green Cloister, with the frescoes "on the green ground" (hence its name) by Paolo Uccello; the Cappellone degli Spagnoli and the Cloister of the Dead. Also the refectory, which is a true exhibition space, houses paintings and sacred vestments, metalwork, relics and liturgical vestments. Finally, linked to the Basilica is the Santa Maria Novella Pharmacy, the oldest in Europe, which has been open continuously for more than four centuries.
